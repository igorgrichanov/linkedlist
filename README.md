# linkedlist

A task about building a double linked list with fake data generation and the QuickSort algorithm


Data loaded from 'test.json' to a 'Commit' struct, then sorted by 'Date' with the help of the QuickSort algorithm. Several methods have been implemented for double linked list.

Every method has its own test and benchmark. To test methods, random data generator has been implemented.
